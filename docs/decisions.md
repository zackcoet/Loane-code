# Decision log

Why things are the way they are. Newest first. When we change our minds, we
add a new entry rather than editing an old one — the reasoning matters as
much as the answer.

---

## 2026-09-27 — Sign-up runs entirely on the server

**Decision:** The app no longer creates Firebase Auth accounts. One callable
function, `createAccount`, checks the school domain, creates the login,
writes the profile and claims the username — and deletes the login it just
made if any later step fails. The app then signs in with a one-time token
the function returns.

**Why:** The obvious flow is "app creates the login, then calls us to make
the profile." That leaves a gap where a login exists with no Loane profile,
and anyone willing to skip the second call could sit there indefinitely.
Zack asked whether the server could do the whole thing instead of paying for
Identity Platform. It can, and it closes the gap at no cost.

**Trade-off:** `createCustomToken` needs the functions service account to
hold the "Service Account Token Creator" role in production. A one-time,
free grant in the Google Cloud console. Emulators do not need it.

**Knock-on:** the password now has to survive from the email screen to the
username screen. It is held in memory only and never written to disk, so an
app reload sends her back one screen to retype it.

---

## 2026-09-27 — Campus verification is a 6-digit code, never a link

**Decision:** When we ship real verification it will email a 6-digit code
she types back into the app. Not a magic link.

**Why:** University mail systems run security scanners that follow every
link in incoming mail. A one-time link would be consumed by the scanner
before the student ever saw the email, and she would be locked out through
no fault of her own.

---

## 2026-09-27 — `isVerified` and `emailConfirmed` are two different things

**Decision:** Keep both fields, with sharply different meanings.
`isVerified` means her domain is on the approved list, so she may use the
app — true from signup. `emailConfirmed` means we have proven she controls
that inbox — always false today.

**Why:** Zack asked for `emailConfirmed`. We already had `isVerified`, and
two fields that sound alike are a bug waiting to happen, so the split is
written down here and in the type. When the code ships, `emailConfirmed`
flips and we start enforcing it. No documents migrate.

---

## 2026-09-25 — Skip real campus email verification for MVP

**Decision:** Build the "Verify your campus" screen exactly as designed.
Accept any email that matches an approved campus domain and mark the account
verified. Do not send a confirmation email yet. Do not gate any feature on
`isVerified`.

**Why:** Zack's call — speed to a working product. The screen and the field
both exist, so turning on real verification later is a change to one Cloud
Function and nothing else.

**Risk accepted:** Typing `anyone@sc.edu` proves nothing. Until real
verification ships, "student-only" is an intention, not a guarantee.

**Mitigation:** `verificationMethod` records `domain_claimed` for every
account verified this way, so when real verification ships we know exactly
which accounts were never actually proven. Listed as a must-do gate before
beta launch in [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md).

## 2026-09-25 — Brand colors taken from the deck's swatches, not its printed hex codes

**Decision:** Use `#FFFFF2` cream, `#6F0C27` maroon, `#D6B04D` gold,
`#B5784C` terracotta, `#B8C7C2` sage.

**Why:** The brand deck printed hex codes underneath its swatches that did not
match the swatches for three of five colors — the gold swatch was labelled
`#b8406e` (a pink), the terracotta `#180c04` (a near-black brown), the sage
`#d57296` (a pink). Cream and maroon matched. The three mismatched values were
sampled from the swatch pixels.

**Status:** Gold, terracotta and sage are marked `TODO-CONFIRM` in
`shared/src/brand.ts`. Replace them if the designer supplies exact values.

---

## 2026-09-25 — A separate `loane-dev` Firebase project

**Decision:** Create `loane-dev` for development. Never deploy to the live
`loane-code` project without asking Zack first.

**Why:** Something was already deployed to `loane-code` Hosting in September.
A mistaken deploy would overwrite it. A separate project costs nothing on the
Blaze plan until it is used, and it removes an entire category of accident.

**In practice:** day-to-day work runs against the local Emulator Suite, which
touches neither project.

---

## 2026-09-25 — Money is always integer cents

**Decision:** Every amount is an integer count of US cents. Never a float,
never a string.

**Why:** `0.1 + 0.2` is not `0.3` in floating point. Storing a rental price
as `45.00` guarantees a rounding bug eventually charges someone the wrong
amount. `4500` cannot drift.

---

## 2026-09-25 — Rental dates are calendar dates, and ranges are half-open

**Decision:** Rental dates are plain `"YYYY-MM-DD"` strings, not timestamps. A
booking covers `startDate` up to but **not including** `endDate`.

**Why:** Timestamps drag in time zones, and a rental has nothing to do with
time zones — a dress is booked for Friday, not for Friday 00:00 UTC. Half-open
ranges mean a booking that ends the 10th and one that starts the 10th do not
collide, which is the real-world behaviour: she returns it in the morning, the
next girl takes it that afternoon. Both rules live in `shared/src/dates.ts` so
there is one place to get them right.

---

## 2026-09-25 — Bookings are only ever written by Cloud Functions

**Decision:** The app cannot write to the `bookings` collection at all. It
calls a callable function, which does the work inside a Firestore transaction.

**Why:** Double-booking is the failure that would most damage trust — a girl
showing up for a gameday dress that someone else already has. A transaction is
the only way to make it genuinely impossible rather than merely unlikely.

**Same reasoning applies to:** reviews, all counters, verification status,
roles, reports and claims.

---

## 2026-09-25 — Compound document ids for likes, saves and follows

**Decision:** A like's document id is `{uid}_{postId}` rather than a random id.

**Why:** Double-liking becomes impossible by construction instead of something
we have to check for. Writing the same id twice is one document, not two. It
also makes "has she liked this?" a single cheap read instead of a query.

---

## 2026-09-25 — The campus id is `university-of-south-carolina`, never `usc`

**Decision:** Spell it out. Approved domains: `sc.edu`, `email.sc.edu`.

**Why:** "USC" means University of South Carolina here and University of
Southern California to most of the internet. An ambiguous identifier in a
database is a bug waiting for the second campus to arrive.

---

## 2026-09-25 — Free font stand-ins for now

**Decision:** Ship Archivo Bold in place of Tenorite Bold and Inter in place
of Telegraf, behind the token names `LoaneHeading` and `LoaneBody`.

**Why:** Tenorite is a Microsoft font not licensed for app embedding; Telegraf
is a paid license. Using token names rather than font names means swapping in
the licensed files later touches one file.

---

## 2026-09-25 — Who pays the Loane fee is left open

**Decision:** Not decided. Default to the renter paying it on top of the
rental price. Record `feePaidBy` on every booking.

**Why:** It is a business decision, not an engineering one, and it does not
need to be made yet. Recording the split per booking means changing the answer
later never rewrites past bookings.

**Decide by:** Phase 5.

---

## 2026-09-25 — One repo with npm workspaces

**Decision:** `mobile`, `admin`, `backend/functions` and `shared` in a single
repository.

**Why:** A listing means the same thing in all three. Separate repos would
mean three copies of that definition drifting apart. One repo, one definition,
imported everywhere.
